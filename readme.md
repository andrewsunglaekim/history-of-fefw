# History of front end frameworks

In this talk, we'll explore how far we've come down the evolutionary chain of front end development. Through this exploration, we highlight the importance of the underlying technologies of front end frameworks that we know and love today.

One of the dictionary definitions of history is

```
A chronological record of significant events often including an explanation of their causes.
```

People, throughout time, leverage history as lessons learned. We, as developers, are no different. It's important to know where we came from to identify problems and situations we've already solved.

## A brief history lesson - The beginning

In 1980, Tim Berners-Lee developed and prototyped a system called ENQUIRE at CERN(European Organization for Nuclear Research) that allowed researchers there to communicate with each other. In 1990, HTML was born based off that system.

Soon after, Håkon Wium Lie proposed the first iteration of CSS in 1994. By 1996, CSS became officially published in December.


In 1995, Netscape Communications hired Brendan Eich to embed a programming language into their browser. In May of 1995, Brendan Eich wrote a prototype in 10 days under the name Mocha while officially being called LiveScript. It later was renamed to Javascript to ride on the marketing coat tails of the popular Java programming language.

## Next

Great, we've got our 3 pillars of front end development by 1995. So everything was simple and easy to develop once these specs came out.

Not in the slightest. We faced many issues and still do today with compatibility issues between browsers. That didn't stop developers from creating new features against the browser though.

And we, as developers today, are probably pretty happy with the next "revolution" in front end code.

## AJAX
In 1998, the Microsoft Outlook Web Access team created the core competencies that surrounded the `XMLHttpRequest` object. This gave us as developers the ability to fetch things asynchronously. It allowed us to finally make server requests on the client!

Remember mapquest?

Though there was access to this technology by 1998, it wasn't largely popularized until Google leveraged the technology for their popular Gmail and Google maps web applications.

By April of 2006, the w3c released the first specification for XMLHttpRequest object.
